# Echo Dot Metaphor Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how people describe their Amazon Echo Dot using metaphorical language, revealing the social and functional roles users assign to smart home devices in their homes.

**Research Question**: How do users metaphorically frame their relationship with Echo Dot devices, and what do these framings reveal about human-AI interaction patterns?

## Methodology

### Pattern-Based Extraction Methodology
This analysis uses systematic pattern matching to identify role-based metaphor expressions in user reviews while maintaining high precision through multiple validation filters.

**Pattern Categories Used**:
1. **Explicit Comparison**: "it's like a/my [ROLE]", "like having a [ROLE]"
2. **Plain Copula**: "it/alexa is a/my [ROLE]" (with intensifiers: "basically", "really")
3. **Gendered Pronouns**: "she's my [ROLE]" (captures Alexa as female)
4. **Transformation**: "has become a [ROLE]", "turned into a [ROLE]"
5. **Appositive**: "Alexa, our [ROLE], ..." (embedded roles)
6. **Contrast**: "more like a [ROLE] than [OTHER]"
7. **Possessive**: "it's my [ROLE]" (verified role words)
8. **Intensified Feelings**: "feels almost like a [ROLE]"

**Data Source**: 20,486 Echo Dot reviews â†’ 11,044 with 'hard/soft' topic confidence

### Precision Filters
- **Pattern Validation**: Every metaphor must match a role-shaped sentence
- **Role Morphology**: Validates role-like word endings (-er, -or, -ist)
- **Tautology Ban**: Excludes "echo/dot/alexa" references
- **Adjective Ban**: Rejects descriptive words (excellent, good, best)
- **Technical Ban**: Excludes product terms (device, speaker, gift)
- **Ordinal Ban**: Rejects numbers (first, second, third)
